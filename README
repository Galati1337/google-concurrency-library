The Google Concurrency Library (GCL) is an attempt to export several
internal C++ Google concurrency libraries in a form that the C++
standard committee may accept for TR2.


This project uses cmake as its build system, so you'll need to install
it from http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html or your
distribution.

If you've checked out the Google Concurrency Library to $SRCDIR, then
cd to a build directory and run:

  $ cmake $SRCDIR
  $ make
  $ make test  # or `ctest -V` for full output.
